wobsite is a static site generator designed to be simple and lightweight. It's perfect for building your own blag.

It aims to:
- Support common and widely-used markup formats.
  - wobsite supports HTML5 for templates and pages, as well as markdown for pages.
- Specify the website structure in an obvious and declarative manner.
  - Site, template, and pages are all defined by .toml files with consistent naming rules.
- Have fast compile times.
  - Currently, this is accomplished by keeping a slim feature-set.
  - In the future, I hope to add incremental compiling.

# Features
- Supported languages for templates: HTML5
- Supported languages for pages: HTML5, CommonMark

# Usage
Currently, wobsite is only available as a library. A cli application is planned.

# Contributing
All required libraries are specified in requirements.txt. Additionally, I recommend a type checker such as mypy or Pylance with strict typing enabled
