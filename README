wobsite is a static site generator designed to be simple and lightweight. It's perfect for building your own blag.

It aims to:
- Support common and widely-used markup formats.
  - wobsite supports HTML5 for templates and pages.
- Specify the website structure in an obvious and declarative manner.
  - Site, template, and pages are all defined by .toml files with consistent naming rules.
- Have fast compile times.
  - Currently, this is accomplished by keeping a slim feature-set.
  - In the future, I hope to add incremental compiling.

# Usage
python wobsite_cli <path_to_wobsite_directory>

All required libraries are specified in requirements.txt.
For an example wobsite, see the example/ folder.

# Contributing
wobsite uses python type hints. I recommend a type checker such as mypy or Pyright (Pylance) with strict typing enabled
